- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Victoria!
- ðŸŒ± A PhD student by title & an optimizer by nature 
ðŸ“š My research interests lie at the intersections of applied statistics and statistical learning, inference, and large-scale optimization, particularly in the context of decision-making under risk and uncertainty. 
- Currently, I am focusing on the trade-off between privacy and robustness in statistical machine learning, using quantile loss as a robust metric to evaluate model performance
